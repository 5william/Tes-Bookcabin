# BookCabin Assessment

### 🛠 Notes
APK and Screen record is using mock for testing

* **To Disable Mocking:** Navigate to `build.gradle.kts (:data)` and set:
  ```groovy
  buildConfigField("boolean", "USE_MOCK_DATA", "false")
* Please note that I didn't test directly on the API as I think the test data might be outdated.
